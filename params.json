{"name":"Imagebattlefx","tagline":"Create a ranking of pictures by comparing them one on one.","body":"# ImageBattleFx\r\nCreate a ranking of pictures by comparing them one on one.\r\n\r\nIt compares *images* in a *battle* one image versus another and uses Java *FX* for the GUI.\r\nThe build is done with gradle.\r\nEach battle result will trigger a save. Results are stored as a graph in the directory alongside with the images.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nYou only need Java 8 with JavaFx. So maybe on Linux you need to get yourself an Oracle JRE.\r\n\r\n## How to get it\r\n\r\nDownload: [Version 0.0.3](https://github.com/KoaGex/ImageBattleFx/releases/download/v0.0.3/ImageBattleFx-0_0_3.zip)\r\n\r\nThen simply unzip it. No installation required.\r\n\r\n## How to use it\r\nNavigate into the bin directory and start it with start.bat or start.sh.\r\nA Directory chooser should open.\r\nChoose a directory that contains some images.\r\nNow you see two of those images. Click the one you like the most.\r\nRepeat until the you have enough. In the top right corner is a button to view the current state of the ranking.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
