# ImageBattleFx
Create a ranking of pictures by comparing them one on one.


## If you just want to use it
See http://koagex.github.io/ImageBattleFx/

## Technical Background

It compares *images* in a *battle* one image versus another and uses Java *FX* for the GUI.
The build is done with gradle.
Each battle result will trigger a save. Results are stored as a graph in the directory alongside with the images.

## Requirements

You only need Java 8 with JavaFx. So maybe on Linux you need to get yourself an Oracle JRE.
