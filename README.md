# ImageBattleFx
Create a ranking of pictures by comparing them one on one.

It compares *images* in a *battle* one image versus another and uses Java *FX* for the GUI.
The build is done with gradle.
Each battle result will trigger a save. Results are stored as a graph in the directory alongside with the images.

## Requirements

You only need Java 8 with JavaFx. So maybe on Linux you need to get yourself an Oracle JRE.

## How to get it

Download: [Version 0.0.3](https://github.com/KoaGex/ImageBattleFx/releases/download/v0.0.3/ImageBattleFx-0_0_3.zip)

Then simply unzip it. No installation required.

## How to use it
Navigate into the bin directory and start it with start.bat or start.sh.
A Directory chooser should open.
Choose a directory that contains some images.
Now you see two of those images. Click the one you like the most.
Repeat until the you have enough. In the top right corner is a button to view the current state of the ranking.
